# WilliamMorris_CS3020

Compilation of Assignments from C# course (CS3020) at UCCS Spring 2019

HW1: Introductory program that performs operations from a menu.

HW2: Character Battle - Simulation of a 2-D character battle using fundamental OOP concepts

HW3: File Copier - Recursive function to copy chosen directories and subdirectories. The config.txt file is with HW3.sln. You need to add the config.txt file to the bin folder though in order for the program to work.

HW4: Introductory Media Manager. Instructions were followed as best as possible while still also producing a working program.

HW5: Linq problems - Problems that can be solved without linq and more effieciently with Linq.

Collision Detection: Optimization of a multi-threaded program to increase the amount of collisions able to be made per FPS.

Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe: Application that allows a user to connect to someone else over the same network and play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Sudoku: Sudoku application that is able to create a sudoku board of various difficulty (Easy, Med, Hard) or import a board from a text file and also able to solve the board after creation. Solving method uses recursion. 

Media Manager: Final project that uses C# and winforms to create an application that allows users to edit the ID3 tags of a mp3 file and also download music from youtube as mp3. The youtube music downloader uses multi-asynchronous threads to download music files up to 5 at once.
  * Issues: Currently some problem with the multi-asynchronous threading where deadlock occurs. Currently looking into this issue for a solution.
